This project Budgitt was a budgeting website coded as a final project with two other students in CS 50. It was coded initially in the modified Cloud9 IDE, which was the environment that the course required, so I have transferred it here. The following is the documentation for the project.

To start using Budgitt, start apache50 in a way similar to in pset7, with the public folder within finproj as the root (execute: apache50 start ~/workspace/finproj/public). Start mysql50 as well (execute: mysql50 start) and recreate the tables and data from finproj.sql in the finproj folder. To use the actual website, visit https://ide50-username.cs50.io/ where username is the username of the ide50 user (ide50 only works with CS50 IDE username and password).

Register a new user by clicking register on the login page. Enter in the appropriate user information in the form to register. Once you’ve registered, log in with your new account.

Once logged in, the homepage lets you know how many more days are left in your spending period and the start and end dates of your current spending period based on the number of days you entered in your registration form.
Before you can enter in any items that you spent money on, you must add categories that your purchases belong to (e.g. Food, Bills, etc.). You can do this on the Settings page, a link to which can be found on the header to the left of Log Out. Make sure “Add a New Category” is selected in the dropdown menu, and enter in the appropriate information in the “Add a New Category” box. Continue adding categories to your satisfaction and/or until you’ve added all categories that your spending fits into. On the home page, you can find the listing of all your categories of the current spending period, including ideal spending (what you put in through the settings) and actual spending (the amount you actually spent).

Once you’ve created categories, you can move on to inputting purchases through the Add Item page. Input the necessary information on the form, and if the category matches one of your existing categories, it will be added to your purchase history. To view your purchase history for your current spending period, view the Purchases page. This page will list your purchases and details about each purchase, how much money spent, the date, etc.
In the History page, you will see one pie chart for each spending period of the distribution of spending among the categories from the first spending period to the current spending period. For each of those periods, next to the pie chart, you can see the comparison between the total ideal spending and the total actual spending in that period.

If you wish to edit the ideal spending for any of your existing categories, visit the Settings page once again and select “Edit Category Ideal Spending” in the dropdown menu and fill in and submit the appropriate information in the form. Similarly, if you wish to change alert settings (getting email alerts vs. not getting alerts), you can choose “Change Alert Options” in the dropdown menu and select and submit the appropriate box.

On the homepage, the number of days remaining in the spending period is displayed. When the number of days remaining reaches 0 or if you encounter a reason to start a new spending period early or late, easily start a new spending period of a certain number of days by inputting the desired length of the new spending period and submitting the form right on the homepage. With each new spending period, you must create the desired categories in Settings, even if they are the same as the previous spending period.
